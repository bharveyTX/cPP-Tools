== Introduction
The CCUF established the Team Tools Working Group to work on a set of tools for iTCs. The overall goal is to produce a set of guidance documents on how to use the tools for an iTC and templates for the documents the iTC will need (both to product, such as a cPP and for the processes of managing the iTC itself). The output from this group is intended to be freely available to all iTCs, and will hopefully be maintained over the long term.

The work is being done in GitHub at https://github.com/itc-wgtools/cPP-Tools.

The https://github.com/itc-wgtools/cPP-Tools/wiki[wiki] has a list of meeting notes as well as a lot of other related information that doesn't fit neatly into the templates or the web pages here.

== Tools and Guidance
Any set of tools on its own isn't very useful, so in conjunction with the tools in GitHub is a set of documentation provided on this site to help explain how to use the tools and some of the general back end work that needs to be done to support the iTC.

The guidance is broken into several areas:

* link:/admin-guide/index.html[Administrator Guidance]
* link:/user-guide/index.html[User Guidance]
* link:/examples/examples.html[Examples for the cPPs and SD]
* https://github.com/itc-wgtools/cPP-Tools/wiki/Recommended-External-Tools[Recommended External Tools]
* link:/files_list.html[Description of currently available templates]

Documents that are available for public review can be seen at the link:/drafts/drafts.html[Drafts] page. This will include information about submitting comments to the WG.

== Current Status
The WG has released the updates targeted for the Spring 2020 CCUF meetings (even though they have been canceled). The primary focus of this effort has been to provide an outline for maintenance and interpretations, along with some tweaks to the previously released documentation.

To provide a better naming convention towards the updates provided by the WG, we are moving from "Phase X" for "YYYY.ZZ" where YYYY will be the year and ZZ will be the release number (generally this will probably only be 2-4 times a year, but we could handle more if needed). So the Phase 3 update has become the 2020.01 update.

== Next Focus
With the 2020.01 document release, the WG feels that we are at a point that the templates and guidance is usable by any iTC, and needs feedback to move further. There are additional areas beyond this set of documents that we feel could use more input, and this will be the focus of the group for new content. The WG plans to work towards an outline of dealing with document lifecycles, sunsetting and handling the integration of Technical Decisions into the documents in addition to answering questions and assisting with iTCs starting to use the templates as they exist today.

== Public Presentation of the Work
So far the content has been presented three times publically.

Note that the YouTube videos are both around 1.5 hours. The first one is more about thoughts and planning directions while the second one focuses on the initial set of documentation that is available for use.

== Eating Our Own Dog Food
This WG has been attempting to use what we are providing for the wider community. This has helped (and probably hurt initially as we all learned from the experience, but that was the point), but hopefully the efforts of the WG will benefit the wider community as we go forward.
